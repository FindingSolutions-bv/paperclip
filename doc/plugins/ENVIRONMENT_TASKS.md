# Typed environment tasks

An environment driver can own task admission without exposing a shell or creating
one disposable resource per run. Declare `supportsTasks: true` on the driver and
implement `onEnvironmentTask`. The worker advertises `environmentTask` during
initialization. Both declarations must be present. The existing
`environment.drivers.register` capability applies.

The server-only `environmentRuntime.task({companyId, leaseId, operation})` method
loads the persisted lease and its run. It resolves the exact plugin recorded at
acquisition. It supplies the agent, issue, and project context. It does not accept
these identities or the plugin identity from the operation. An environment edit
cannot redirect an existing task to a replacement provider. The caller must
already authorize access to the company.

This contract supplies execution capabilities. It does not select a provider for
heartbeat runs, stage runtime assets, or replace native Runner startup. Consumers
must integrate those steps before enabling task execution. Readiness checks remain
separate. No browser endpoint or automatic provider selection is added.

## Lifetime and operations

Acquire the environment lease before submitting a task. The provider lease ID is
the task's durable attempt ID. Save it before a remote call. Do not use a persistent
machine ID as this task ID. Multiple attempts can use the same underlying resource. Provider task IDs are
opaque strings; each provider owns its addressing constraints.

- `submit`: supplies typed Runner identity, source revision, harness, optional
  outbound WSS URL, and a transient bootstrap ticket. The Runner run and lease IDs
  must match the persisted host records. Only a running run with an active,
  unexpired lease can submit.
- `status`: returns the phase and optional exit code. Optional `executionStopped`
  is live provider evidence that the complete task process tree has stopped.
- `connection`: returns a private authenticated WebSocket endpoint for a running
  task. Transport credentials remain on the server. PRP authentication still binds
  the Runner to its authorized run.
- `complete`: releases task grants according to the provider's policy. It does not
  imply that the process or its descendants stopped.
- `stop`: requests cancellation of the task. An accepted request is not a process
  termination receipt. Reconcile status before treating execution as stopped.

Submission, completion and stop return `accepted`. Acceptance does not imply
readiness or success. Status and connection return distinct typed results. Every
result echoes the task ID and is checked by both the worker SDK and the host.

## Retry and credentials

A timeout may follow successful admission. Retain the same task ID and launch
configuration, inspect status, and retry the exact request when needed. Never
allocate a second attempt merely because the response was lost. Providers must
reject conflicting reuse and deduplicate identical submissions, including after a
terminal outcome. A new execution attempt requires a new lease and task ID.

Do not store bootstrap tickets, connection headers, or provider credentials in
lease metadata, plugin state, run profiles, logs, or browser responses. The host
sanitizes worker errors. Treat a connection result as credential-bearing material.
An endpoint is transport access, not a replacement for the Runner protocol's
identity and artifact verification.

Providers own resource-specific credential lookup, mounts, task status, and cleanup.
Task lease cleanup must never destroy a longer-lived resource as an implicit
fallback. Unsupported operations and unavailable providers fail closed.

Cleanup operations (`status`, `complete`, `stop`) remain available when an
environment or run has been deleted. The corresponding `environmentId`, `runId`,
and `agentId` can be null. Providers must use their persisted lease binding for
cleanup; they must not need a current project or environment configuration.
Submission and connection require the environment and running run to still exist.
